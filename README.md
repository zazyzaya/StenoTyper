# StenoTyper
Converts the keyboard into a stenographer's keyboard    
I have no idea why anyone would ever need this    

# Requirements:
python 3   
pynput      
To obtain pynput, simply use the command
```
pip install pynput
```
and it will be installed

# Mapping
The keyboard is arranged like this:
(lowercase letters are qwerty, uppercase is Steno)
```
      ____ ____ ____ ____ __ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____   
     /q S /w T /e P/ r H|t * |y F \u P \i L \o T \p D\    
     |   |____|____|____|    |____|____|____|____|____|    
     |   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    
     \a S\ s K\ d W\ f R|g * |h R /j B /k G /l S /; Z/    
      \___\____\____\___|____|___/____/____/____/___/    
                  |    |    |    |    |    
                  \c A |v O | b E| n U/    
                   \___|____|____|___/    
```

Just like a normal stenograph, hold down multiple keys to create "chords" and release to print the line
